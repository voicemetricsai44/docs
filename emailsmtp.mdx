title: "Email SMTP"
description: "Email SMTP Integration allows you to send platform-generated emails—such as password resets, alerts, and notifications—directly from your own branded email address. This ensures a professional experience where all communications appear to come from your agency or business. All SMTP credentials are securely stored and used only for sending emails on your behalf."

## **Why SMTP Integration Matters**
