## **What is a Tag?**

A **Tag** is a label used to categorize and group leads based on attributes like interest, status, or actions. Tags help streamline organizations and allow for quick filtering and segmentation.

Easily add, edit, or remove tags to keep your lead management dynamic and efficient.
