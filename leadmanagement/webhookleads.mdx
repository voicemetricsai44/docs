## **Webhooks – Capturing & Updating Leads**

Webhooks allow external tools and platforms (like CRM systems, landing pages, or marketing forms) to push data into your white-label Voice AI platform. With lead webhooks, you can **automatically add or update leads**, assign them to lists or tags, and **trigger outbound call automations** in real-time.

## **Webhooks Overview**

Webhooks provide a seamless way to:

- **Capture new leads** from any external platform
- **Update lead information** (e.g., name, phone, email, tags)
- **Organize leads** into lists or apply tags for segmentation
- **Trigger Outbound Automations** based on new lead creation

Webhooks save time and improve lead response speed by automating the lead ingestion process, without any manual entry.

## **What is a Lead Webhook?**

A **Lead Webhook** is a unique URL where you can send HTTP POST requests to add or update lead data.

## **How It Works:**

- You connect your third-party platform (e.g., CRM, form builder, ad tool) to the webhook URL.
- When a new lead is generated or updated, data is sent to the webhook.
- The system **automatically adds or updates** the lead record in the client account.
- Tags or lists (if configured) are applied, and **outbound automations** can be triggered instantly.

## **How to Create a Webhook**

Follow these steps to create a lead webhook inside your platform:

 1. Navigate to **Webhooks **Menu 

- From your Client Account, go to **Settings \> Webhooks**

2. Click “**Create Webhook**”

- Click the **Create Webhook** button to begin.

**3. Fill in the Webhook Details**

- **Webhook Name** – Give a recognizable name (e.g., “Facebook Leads”)
- **Webhook URL** – A unique system-generated endpoint where you’ll send data

  </Note>

4. Field Mapping

1. Map the data fields you will send to the appropriate lead fields:
   - First Name
   - Last Name
   - Phone Number
   - Email
   - Any custom fields (e.g., budget, service interest)

5. Tag/List Management (Optional)

1. Apply your desired Tags
   - Apply default **Tags** (e.g., “facebook_ads”, “hot_leads”)
   - Assign leads to specific **Lists** for targeted follow-up or automation.

## **Sending Data via Webhook**

Make a **POST** request from your external tool (e.g., Zapier, Make, N8N, CRM) to the provided webhook URL with your lead data.

```
Example Payload:
{
  "first_name": "John",
  "last_name": "Doe",
  "phone": "+1234567890",
  "email": "john.doe@example.com",
  "tags": ["hot_lead", "demo_requested"],
  "list_id": "real_estate_campaign"
}
```

<Warning>
  If the lead already exists (matched by phone number), it will be **updated** instead of **duplicated**.
</Warning>

## **Automation Trigger**

You can set up **Outbound Call Automations** to trigger when:

- A **new lead is added**
- A **lead is updated with specific tags or lists**

This ensures the lead gets contacted instantly without delays.

## **Use Cases**

- Facebook/Instagram Ads – Capture leads from ad forms and start voice conversations instantly
- Landing Page Forms – Send leads from your website to AI agents via webhook
- CRM → Platform Sync – Keep your CRM leads updated and initiate outreach calls
- Auto-assign tags/lists for dynamic campaigns
