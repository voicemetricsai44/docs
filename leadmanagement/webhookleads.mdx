description: "Webhooks allow external tools and platforms (like CRM systems, landing pages, or marketing forms) to push data into your white-label Voice AI platform. With lead webhooks, you can automatically add or update leads, assign them to lists or tags, and trigger outbound call automations in real-time."

## **Webhooks Overview**

Webhooks provide a seamless way to:

- **Capture new contacts **from any external platform
- **Update contact information** (e.g., name, phone, email, tags)
- **Organize contacts **into lists or apply tags for segmentation
- **Trigger Outbound Automations** based on new contact creation

Webhooks save time and improve contact response speed by automating the contact ingestion process, eliminating the need for manual entry.

## **What is a Contact Webhook?**

A **Contact Webhook** is a unique URL where you can send HTTP POST requests to add or update contact data.

## **How It Works**

- You connect your third-party platform (e.g., CRM, form builder, ad tool) to the webhook URL.
- When a new contact is generated or updated, data is sent to the webhook.
- The system **automatically adds or updates** the contact record in the client account.
- Tags or lists (if configured) are applied, and **outbound automations** can be triggered instantly.

## **How to Create a Webhook**

Follow these steps to create a contact webhook inside your platform: 

1. Navigate to the **Contacts** Menu 
2. Click on three dots (⋮) \> tap “**Webhooks**”
3. Click the **Create Webhook** button to begin.
4. Fill in the **Webhook** Details

- **Webhook Name** – Give a recognizable name (e.g., “Facebook Leads”)
- **Webhook URL** – A unique system-generated endpoint where you’ll send data

  <Note>
    Example: https://demo.aivoiceagent.app/server/Customize/Webhooks/webhook.php?id=684828
  </Note>

4. Field Mapping
5. Map the data fields you will send to the appropriate lead fields:
   - First Name
   - Last Name
   - Phone Number
   - Email
   - Any custom fields (e.g., budget, service interest)
6. Tag/List Management (Optional)
7. Apply your desired Tags
   - Apply default **Tags** (e.g., “facebook_ads”, “hot_leads”).
   - Assign leads to specific **Lists** for targeted follow-up or automation.

## **Sending Data via Webhook**

Make a **POST** request from your external tool (e.g., Zapier, Make, N8N, CRM) to the provided webhook URL with your contact data.

```
Example Payload:
{
  "first_name": "John",
  "last_name": "Doe",
  "phone": "+1234567890",
  "email": "john.doe@example.com",
  "tags": ["hot_lead", "demo_requested"],
  "list_id": "real_estate_campaign"
}
```

<Warning>
  If the lead already exists (matched by phone number), it will be **updated** instead of **duplicated**.
</Warning>

## **Automation Trigger**

You can set up **Outbound Call Automations** to trigger when:

- A **new contact is added**
- A **contact is updated with specific tags or lists**

This ensures the contact gets dialled instantly without delays.

## **Use Cases**

- Facebook/Instagram Ads – Capture contacts from ad forms and start voice conversations instantly
- Landing Page Forms – Send contacts from your website to AI agents via webhook
- CRM → Platform Sync – Keep your CRM contacts updated and initiate outreach calls
- Auto-assign tags/lists for dynamic campaigns
