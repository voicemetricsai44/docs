## **Overview**

**Outbound Call Automation** is similar to building an ActiveCampaign-style workflow â€” but for voice calls. It allows you to trigger AI-powered calls based on real-time events, such as new lead creation, lead updates, or other webhook-based triggers from CRMs or apps.

This lets you automate follow-ups and outreach instantly without scheduling a campaign manually.
