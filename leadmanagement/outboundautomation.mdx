title: "Outbound Automation "
description: "Outbound Call Automation is similar to building an ActiveCampaign-style workflow — but for voice calls. It allows you to trigger AI-powered calls based on real-time events, such as new contact creation, lead updates, or other webhook-based triggers from CRMs or apps. This lets you automate follow-ups and outreach instantly without scheduling a campaign manually."

  </Step>
  <Step title="Choose a Trigger" stepNumber={2} titleSize="p">
     Select which event will start the call automation:

    - When a **Contact is Created**
    - When a **Contact is Updated**
    - When a **Contact is Created or Updated**
    - When a**Webhook is triggered ** (Allows your AI agent to call new contacts in GHL)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Webhook URL Setup" stepNumber={3} titleSize="p">
    - Use the following webhook URL to trigger this automation from your CRM.\
      Replace the macros with the **corresponding fields** from your CRM system.
      - Go to GHL CRM \> **Sub Account** \> **Automations \> Create Workflow**
      - Create a Trigger and paste the Webhook URL under **Actions**
    - This helps target only new contacts, irrespective of the list and tags.

  </Step>
  <Step title="Set Call Schedule" stepNumber={4} titleSize="p">
    - Define business hours to avoid calling outside working hours (e.g., 10 AM – 6 PM)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure Redial Logic" stepNumber={5} titleSize="p">
    If a call fails or goes unanswered:

    - Retry after 15 minutes (1st attempt)
    - Retry after 4 hours (2nd attempt)
    - Retry next day (3rd attempt)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Post-Call Actions" stepNumber={6} titleSize="p">
    - AI validates the conversation
    - Uses **#Extract_Info** to capture lead data (name, email, intent, etc.)
    - Uses **#Book_Calendar** to schedule appointments
    - Sends call data to CRM or Google Sheets via **#Post_Call_Event** webhook
    - View full call logs and transcripts in **Call History**
  </Step>
</Steps>
