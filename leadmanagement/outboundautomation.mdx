title: "Outbound Automation "
---

## **Overview**

**Outbound Call Automation** is similar to building an ActiveCampaign-style workflow — but for voice calls. It allows you to trigger AI-powered calls based on real-time events, such as new lead creation, lead updates, or other webhook-based triggers from CRMs or apps.

This lets you automate follow-ups and outreach instantly without scheduling a campaign manually.

## **How It Works**

<Steps>
  <Step title="Name Your Automation" stepNumber={1} titleSize="p">
    Give your automation a descriptive name for easy identification (e.g., “New Facebook Lead Follow-Up”).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Choose a Trigger" stepNumber={2} titleSize="p">
     Select what event will start the call automation:

    - When a **Lead is Created**
    - When a **Lead is Updated**
    - When a **Lead is Created or Updated**
  </Step>
  <Step title="Apply Conditions (Optional)" stepNumber={3} titleSize="p">
    - Run automation only if:
      - The lead belongs to a **specific list**
      - A **specific tag** is applied
    - This helps target only qualified leads or specific campaigns
  </Step>
  <Step title="Assign an Agent & Phone Number" stepNumber={4} titleSize="p">
    - Choose the AI agent that will handle the call
    - Assign the outbound phone number (must be imported from **Vapi** or **Retell AI**)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Set Call Schedule" stepNumber={5} titleSize="p">
    Define business hours to avoid calling outside working hours (e.g., 10 AM – 6 PM)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Define Call Concurrency" stepNumber={6} titleSize="p">
    - Choose how many calls to run in parallel
    - Example: Set concurrency to 20 to dial 20 leads at once
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure Redial Logic" stepNumber={7} titleSize="p">
    1. If a call fails or goes unanswered:
       - Retry after 15 minutes (1st attempt)
       - Retry after 4 hours (2nd attempt)
       - Retry next day (3rd attempt)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Post-Call Actions" stepNumber={8} titleSize="p">
    - AI validates the conversation
    - Uses #Extract_Info to capture lead data (name, email, intent, etc.)
    - Uses #Book_Calendar to schedule appointments
    - Sends call data to CRM or Google Sheets via #Post_Call_Event webhook
    - View full call logs and transcripts in **Call History**
  </Step>
</Steps>

## **Use Case Examples**

- **Instant Lead Follow-Up**\
  Trigger a call when a lead fills out a form or subscribes via a landing page.
- **CRM Lead Re-Engagement**\
  Call warm or reactivated leads as soon as their status changes.
- **Tag-Based Triggering**\
  Auto-call when a lead gets tagged as “Hot,” “Schedule Call,” or “Demo Booked.”
- **Appointment Reminder Calls**\
  Trigger calls 1 hour before a scheduled appointment to reduce no-shows.
- **Missed Payment or Renewal Alert**\
  Automatically notify users when their subscription is about to expire.

Use this with:

- **CRMs** like HubSpot, Zoho, and GoHighLevel
- **Forms & Lead Sources** like Facebook Ads, Google Ads, Typeform
- **Automation Tools** like Zapier, [Make.com](http://Make.com), N8N

</Note>
