  - **Brand Voice:** Keep language consistent with your agency’s tone — professional, helpful, and clear.
  - **Responsiveness:** Templates are mobile-optimized, but test them on multiple devices for best results.
  - **Fallback:** If a variable isn't available (e.g., missing plan name), the platform will use a default or leave it blank.
