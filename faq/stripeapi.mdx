## How to generate an API Key from a Stripe Account

**1. Log in to Your Stripe Account**

- Go to the [Stripe Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/) and log in using your credentials.

**2. Navigate to API Settings**

- From the dashboard, click on Developers in the left-hand menu.
- Select API Keys from the submenu.

**3. Create a New API Key**

- Under the Standard Keys section, click "**Create Secret Key**".
- Enter a name or description for the key (optional but recommended for identification).
- Click "**Create**" to generate the key.

**4. Copy the API Key**

- Once created, the **secret API key** will be displayed.
- **Copy the key immediately**, as you won’t be able to view it again later.

**5. Secure Your API Key**

- **Store the API key** in a secure location, such as an environment variable or a secure key management system.
- **Do not share your API key publicly** to prevent unauthorized access.

## Test Mode Vs Live Mode

<Note>
  Use test API keys for **testing** your application during development.
  Use live API keys for **production** environments to process actual transactions.
</Note>

<Warning>
  **Copy the Key Immediately**, as you won’t be able to view it again later.

  - Regularly rotate your API keys to maintain security.
  - You can revoke and generate new keys from the API Keys section.
