## **Client Subscription Overview**

This guide explains how clients subscribe to a plan and continue using the platform after their trial ends. It covers trial access, plan details, billing flow, minute usage, and how agencies profit.

## **Free Trial Access**

New clients start with a **free trial**, configured by the agency.

- Clients can explore the platform **without payment** or subscription.
- After the trial, clients must subscribe to a plan to keep using the platform.

## **Refill Add-On Minutes (Auto Refill)**

<Accordion title="Manual Refill" iconType="regular">
  When free minutes run out, clients can continue usage through **add-on minutes**.

  - Clients **select a refill amount** (e.g., 100 / 500 / 1,000 minutes).
  - The refill is stored in a wallet and used automatically once free minutes are exhausted.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Auto Refill" iconType="regular">
  When the wallet balance drops below **10%** of the last refill amount, the system **auto-refills**.

  - Ensures **uninterrupted service** with no manual top-ups.
  - The auto-refill amount is billed directly from the **client’s saved card.**
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Minute Usage Flow" iconType="regular">
  1. The platform first uses the **free minutes** from the active subscription plan.
  2. **After free minutes:**
     - Minutes are consumed from the **Add-On Wallet**.
     - If the wallet is low, **auto-refill** activates based on settings.
  3. Clients can monitor everything inside their **Billing Dashboard**.
