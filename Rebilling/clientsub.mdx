</Tip>

## **Refill Add-On Minutes (Auto Refill)**

When free minutes run out, clients can continue usage through **add-on minutes**.

- Clients select a refill amount (e.g., 100 / 500 / 1,000 minutes).
- The refill is stored in a wallet and used automatically once free minutes are exhausted.

**Auto Refill:**

- When the wallet balance drops below **10%** of the last refill amount, the system **auto-refills**.
- Ensures uninterrupted service with no manual top-ups.
- The auto-refill amount is billed directly from the clientâ€™s saved card.

**Minute Usage Flow**

1. The platform first uses the **free minutes** from the active subscription plan.
2. After free minutes:
   - Minutes are consumed from the **Add-On Wallet**.
   - If the wallet is low, **auto-refill** activates based on settings.

Clients can monitor everything inside their **Billing Dashboard**.
