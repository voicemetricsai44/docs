## **Default Permissions**

Default permissions are the standard access rights assigned automatically when a user or client account is created. They define what actions the user can perform without requiring manual configuration.

**Example:**

- A new client account may have default permissions to 
  - **Manage AI agents**
  - **Create and manage contacts**
  - **Create and manage campaigns**
  - **Manage call analytics**
- Agency admins can later customize permissions to allow actions like **editing**, **deleting.**

<Note>
  Standard access is **assigned automatically**; it can also be customized per client.
