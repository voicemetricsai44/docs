### **Prompt**

   - First Message: The greeting or intro message is played when a call connects
   - Task Prompt: Core instruction to guide the AI on what to say or do
2. **Using Variables**
   - Use dynamic fields in the prompt using \$
   - Example: Hi \$Lead_Name, I see you're interested in \$Service_Type.
3. **Using Tools (Actions)**
   - Trigger actions with simple commands in the prompt.
   - Example: Use tool #Book_Calendar to schedule an appointment.
