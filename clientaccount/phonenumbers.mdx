## **Overview**

Phone numbers are essential for enabling your AI agent to make and receive calls. You can assign different numbers for various purposes, such as:

- **Inbound calls** (customer calls your business)
- **Outbound calls** (agent initiates call campaigns or automations)

<Warning>
  Only **Agency users** can import phone numbers.

<Warning>
   Make sure **Agency View** is enabled in the client account footer for full access.
