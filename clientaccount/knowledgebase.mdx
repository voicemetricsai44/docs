title: "Knowledge Base"
description: "Your Knowledge Base is a central place to store all the relevant information that your AI agents can refer to during conversations. It powers the agent’s ability to answer questions accurately and contextually based on uploaded content."
---

## **Overview**

A Knowledge Base allows you to upload reference materials such as:

- Product documents
- Service descriptions
- FAQs
- Help articles
- Company details
- CRM data (in readable format)

This content becomes part of the agent's “brain” and helps it respond more intelligently during calls.

## **Create Knowledge Base**

You can manually create a new Knowledge Base and add different content types:

**Supported Content Types:**

- **Files** – Upload PDF, DOCX, TXT, and other readable formats
- **Page URLs** – Add website URLs to fetch indexed page content
- **Text Snippets** – Add plain text manually

**Steps to Add:**

1. Go to the **Knowledge Base** tab in your dashboard.
2. Use the **Add** option:
   - Click **Upload File** to select and upload documents.
   - Click **Add URL** to enter website links.
   - Click **Add Text** to enter plain text notes.

## **Import Knowledge Base**

**Overview**

You can easily import existing Knowledge Base (Infobase) content from supported providers like **Retell AI** and **Vapi** to jumpstart your agent training process with pre-existing data.

<Warning>
  This feature is only available for Agency users, **not for client app users**. Make sure to enable Agency View from the footer of the client account menu to access this functionality.
</Warning>

This helps you preserve structured data like FAQs, documents, and external sources already curated in your current setup.
