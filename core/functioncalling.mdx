title: "Function Calling (Actions)"
description: "Actions are the automation tools behind your voice agent. They allow your agent to perform tasks, not just talk, such as booking appointments, transferring calls, sending emails/SMS, and even triggering custom workflows via API. Think of Actions as “function blocks” that you can link to your agent’s prompt. When the prompt calls an Action, it’s like pressing a button to get something done automatically."

## **Why Use Actions?**

Without Actions, your agent is limited to just conversation.

With Actions, your agent can:

- Automatically check calendar availability and book appointments
- Transfer calls to real humans
- Collect and send lead data
- Send confirmation SMS or emails
- Trigger CRM/webhook integrations and much more

<Note>
  **Use Actions to turn conversations into conversions.**
</Note>

## **Available Action Types**

1. **End Call Action**
   - Gracefully ends the conversation when the agent completes its task.
2. **Call Transfer Action**
   - Transfers the call to another phone number, agent, or department.
3. **Calendar Booking Action**
   - Book an appointment using your connected calendar service.
4. **Extract Call Info Action**
   - Captures caller details like name, email, or custom inputs during the conversation.
5. **Send Call Event Action**
   - Triggers a webhook or event immediately after the call ends (e.g., to CRM or automation platforms).
6. **Send Email Action**
   - Send an email during or after the call with relevant information.
7. **Send SMS Action**
   - Sends a text message automatically (e.g., confirmation, links, updates).
8. **Custom Action**
   - Executes custom API calls or workflows defined by your client.

## **How It Works**

1. **Create Actions**
   - From the **Actions tab** in the client account, you can create any of the supported action types.
2. **Link to Prompt**
   - Inside your agent’s prompt, reference the Action by using the defined name (e.g., #Send_SMS or #Book_Calendar).
3. **Trigger Automatically**
   - When the agent reaches that part of the conversation, the linked Action will execute in real time.

```Example Prompt (Using Actions)

Hi, thanks for calling.
Ask for the caller's name and phone number.
Use #Book_Calendar to schedule a meeting.
After booking, use #Send_SMS to send confirmation details.
Say goodbye and use #End_Call to finish the call.
```

</CodeGroup>

<Note>
  Each Action must be **created and configured first** before linking it in the prompt.

  - You can reuse Actions across multiple agents.
  - **Custom Actions** allow powerful API-based workflows tailored to your client's business logic.
