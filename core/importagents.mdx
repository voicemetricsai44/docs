This is ideal for agencies managing multiple accounts or transitioning existing setups into a white-label environment.

<Note>
  This feature is **only available for Agency users**, not for client app users.

<Warning>
  Make sure to **enable Agency View** from the footer of the client account menu to access this functionality.

## **Steps to Import an Agent**

1. **Navigate to the Agent Import Section**
   - Go to the **Agents** tab in your dashboard.
   - Click **"Import Agent"**.
2. **Select Agent(s) to Import**
   - A list of available agents will appear.
   - You can select one or multiple agents for import.
3. **Optional Settings (Before Import)**
   - **Import all associated phone numbers**
   - **Import existing call logs**
4. **Review & Confirm**
   - Review selected agents and settings.
   - Click **“Import”** to begin the process.

## **Best Practices**

- **No Duplicate Imports**\
  You cannot import agents that already exist in your current account or are linked to another workspace.
- **Only Core Data Is Imported**\
  The import will include the agent’s **core setup and settings** only.
- **Manual Setup Required for Advanced Features**\
  After importing, you'll need to manually configure:
  - Function Calling actions
  - Post-call event actions
  - Web widget setups or calendar integrations (if applicable)
- **Use Naming Conventions**\
  Rename imported agents clearly to avoid confusion and align with your project or client structure.
