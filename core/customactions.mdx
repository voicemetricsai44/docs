title: "Custom Actions"
description: "Custom Action enables your voice agent to fetch or send data to any external application via real-time API calls. It's ideal for integrating third-party CRMs, marketing tools, databases, or automation platforms directly within the conversation flow."
---

## **How It Works**

- **Fetch Data from External Tools**
- Pull info during a live call to personalize conversations or validate data.

**Use Case Example:**

- Check if the caller is an existing lead in your CRM
- Retrieve subscription status from your billing system

<Note>
  **Prompt Example:**

  - Use condition **#Check_Lead_Status** to retrieve caller details using the phone number.
</Note>

### **Send Data to External Tools**

Push collected call data to external apps for follow-up actions.

**Use Case Example:**

- Send lead details to a CRM or spreadsheet after the call
- Trigger a drip email campaign in your marketing platform

<Note>
  **Prompt Example:**

  - Use tool #Send_Lead_Info to push the caller's name, email, and interest to CRM.
</Note>

## **Connect with 1000\+ Apps using Automation Tools**

Easily integrate with platforms like:

- **Zapier**
- **Make (Integromat)**
- **n8n**

You can connect to 1000\+ apps like Google Sheets, HubSpot, Pipedrive, Salesforce, Mailchimp, Notion, Airtable, ClickUp, and more.

**Use Cases with Automation Tools:**

- Add a lead to **Google Sheets** after the call
- Create a task in **ClickUp** for a sales rep
- Start a **WhatsApp** or **email sequence** via **MailerLite** or **ActiveCampaign**
- Add or update contacts in **HubSpot CRM**
- Record interest scores to **Notion database**

## **Prompt Example Using Custom Action**

- Use tool #Fetch_Existing_Customer to check the caller status in our CRM. 
- If not found, use tool #Send_New_Lead to send their name, phone number, and intent.

## **Setup Instructions**

**Go to** the **Client Account Settings** → Navigate to **Actions** → Select **Custom Actions**.

1. **Click** on **“Create New Custom Action.”**
2. **Fill in the required fields:**
   - **Name**\
     Provide a unique name for your action (e.g., getUserInfo, lookupEmail). This will be used in the prompt as #ActionName.
   - **Description**\
     Add a short description to guide the AI on when and how to use this action.
   - **Server URL**\
     Enter the target API endpoint that this action will call.
   - **Schema**\
     Define the input/output parameters of the API:
     - **Property Name** – Define the field name (e.g., email, userId)
     - **Description** – Explain the purpose of the field
     - **Type** – Select the data type: String, Number, Boolean, Object, or Array
3. **Save** the action.
4. In the **Agent Settings**, go to **Actions → On Call → Custom Actions** and select the actions your agent should use during the call.
5. **Link it in your agent prompt** using the format **#ActionName**.

## **Best Practices**

- Use descriptive and meaningful action names
- Validate endpoints with Postman before linking
- Use automation tools (Zapier/Make/N8N) if the destination app doesn't support APIs
- Combine with #Extract_Info to send structured data
- Ensure APIs respond within real-time limits (~2-3 seconds)
