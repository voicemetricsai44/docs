title: "Inbound Phone Calls"
description: "Handling inbound phone calls is easy and fully automated. Once your agent is connected to a phone number, the AI can instantly answer incoming calls, qualify leads, extract relevant data, and even book appointments â€” all without human intervention."

## **How It Works**

1. **Create an AI Agent**\
   Build or import your agent and configure its prompts and actions.
2. **Connect a Phone Number**
   - Navigate to the **Phone Numbers** section
   - Import a number from **Twilio**
   - Assign the number to your agent in the **Deploy** tab under agent settings.

3. **Start Receiving Calls**

- The AI will automatically handle all incoming calls on the connected number
- It will greet the caller, ask predefined questions, and complete the conversation

4. **After the Call**

- **Extract information** using the #Extract_Info action
- **Create or update **contacts in your connected CRM
- **Auto-book calendar appointments** via tools like Google Calendar, GHL, or [Cal.com](http://Cal.com)
- Store call logs, summaries, and transcripts under **Conversation.**
