title: "Inbound Phone Calls"
---

## **Overview**

Handling **inbound phone calls** is easy and fully automated. Once your agent is connected to a phone number, the AI can instantly answer incoming calls, qualify leads, extract relevant data, and even book appointments â€” all without human intervention.

## **How It Works**

1. **Create an AI Agent**\
    Build or import your agent and configure its prompts and actions.
2. **Connect a Phone Number**
   - Navigate to the **Phone Numbers** section
   - Import a number from **Vapi** or **Retell AI**
   - Assign the number to your agent in the **Deploy** tab
3. **Start Receiving Calls**
   - The AI will automatically handle all incoming calls on the connected number
   - It will greet the caller, ask predefined questions, and complete the conversation
4. **After the Call**
   - **Extract information** using the #Extract_Info action
   - **Create or update leads** in your connected CRM
   - **Auto-book calendar appointments** via tools like Google Calendar, GHL, or [Cal.com](http://Cal.com)
   - Store call logs, summaries, and transcripts under **Call History**
