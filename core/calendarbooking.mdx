title: "Calendar Booking"
---

## **Overview**

The **Book Calendar Action** enables your voice agent to automatically check calendar availability and book appointments for callers. If the requested time is unavailable, the agent will suggest alternative time slots. This helps streamline bookings and improves the caller experience without human intervention.

## **How It Works**

1. The caller shares a preferred time or date.
2. The agent checks the integrated calendar in real-time.
3. If the time is free, it books the appointment.
4. If not, it offers available time slots to the caller.
5. Once confirmed, the event is added to your calendar.

## **Supported Calendar Integrations**

- Google Calendar
- GoHighLevel Calendar (GHL)
- [Cal.com](http://Cal.com)
