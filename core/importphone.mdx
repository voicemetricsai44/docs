## **Overview**

Easily bring in your existing phone numbers from supported voice platforms to enable outbound and inbound calling for your agents. Currently, importing is supported from the Retell AI and Vapi platforms. (Support for Twilio is coming soon.)

<Note>
  This feature is **only available for Agency users**, not for client app users.

<Warning>
  Make sure to **enable Agency View** from the footer of the client account menu to access this functionality.

## **What You Can Import**
