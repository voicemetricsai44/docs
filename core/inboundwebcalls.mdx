## **How It Works**

1. **Create a Web Widget**
   - Go to **Web Widgets** under the client account
   - Click **Create Widget**
   - Configure:
     - Widget Name
     - Branding (logo, colors, welcome message)
     - Call-to-action text
2. **Deploy the Widget**
   - Copy the embed code
   - Paste it into your website, landing page, or funnel builder
   - Once live, visitors will see a “Click to Call” or “Talk to Assistant” button
3. **Start the Conversation**
   - When a visitor clicks the widget, a voice call is initiated with your AI Agent
   - The agent engages, asks qualifying questions, and guides the caller based on your configured prompt
4. **After the Call**
   - AI uses #Extract_Info to collect details like name, email, and interest level
   - Creates or updates leads in your CRM
   - Uses #Book_Calendar to schedule appointments
   - Stores full **call log**, **summary**, and **transcript** in the **Call History** tab

## **Benefits**

- No phone number required — web-based calling
- Converts passive website traffic into qualified leads
- Works great with landing pages, offer pages, and ad funnels
- Available 24/7 with no human involvement

<Note>
  The widget must be deployed in a **client-owned** website or page

  Use **different widgets** for different use cases (sales, support, booking)
</Note>

<Warning>
  Ensure the agent has appropriate actions set up (e.g., #Extract_Info, #Book_Calendar, #Send_Post_Call_Event)
