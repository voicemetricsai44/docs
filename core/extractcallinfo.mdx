title: "Extract Call Info"
description: "The Extract Info action allows your voice agent to capture and store key details shared by the caller during a conversation. This is useful for collecting structured data like names, contact details, booking info, or custom lead qualifications—automatically and accurately."

## **How It Works**

1. The agent interacts with the caller during the conversation.
2. The **Extract Info** action identifies and extracts predefined data points.
3. Extracted data is stored in the **Call History** for future reference.
4. Data can be forwarded to external tools (like CRMs, Sheets) using the #Post_Call_Event action.

## **What You Can Extract**

You can extract one or more of the following from a single call:

- Name
- Phone Number
- Email Address
- Interest Level
- Booking Date / Time
- Call Rating
- Any custom field relevant to your workflow

<Note>
  Extracted values are tagged and stored automatically. **No need for manual input.**
</Note>

## **Setup Instructions**

1. Navigate to **Actions** → Click **Post Call** → Select **Extract Info**.

     _e.g. Name_
